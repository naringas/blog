# What is time?

A reductionist analysis, in which we analyze time by deducing its components, leads to conclude that time has 3 parts: `past`, `present`, and `future`.

# What is language?

In my views, a language is symbolic system for the description of pretty much anything.  
Again with a reductionist analysis, the most important element of a language is its alphabet of concepts.

In this context, the alphabet is not the single letters which we assemble into words. In this analisys, the alphabet is the concepts, the word-stems perhaps?
This is not a precise theory nor has it been completed.

In any case when I say "the elements of the alaphabet" I could have said "the words" or "the concepts" within the language.


As I have tried to understand the nature of words, language, information, and ultimtely meaning, I found I needed to clarify my ontological posture. If we are to talk about the meaing of _something_. How does this _something_ exist? What is this _something_ which "the information" describes?

Further down this quest to make sense of my (or our) reality I started to clarify my understanding of language.  
I tenously believe that understanding of anything exists relative to a language.

# Rudimentary ontology of time

I am convinced that no argument about the nature of existence can disregard time. In my view, time is the definitory aspect of things which exist.

As I clarified my ontological understanding, I relied on a distinction between things which exist statically and unchanging, and things which exist -- rather, _are existing_ -- dynamically and temporarilly.

Due to this distincion I have concluded that time is fundametally a concept which __exists__; this means that time is an statically unchanging concept.

At the moment I think that static concepts which exist (but aren't __existing__) and abstract ideas contained always within some language.
Some of these abstract ideas are of such mathematically inescapable nature that they will manifest in __any languge__ in some way or another.

The most basic of these ideal and un-physical (non-material) concepts is the void. The next one is time.
