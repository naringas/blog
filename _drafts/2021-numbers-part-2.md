title: Kinds of numbers: part 1 and a half (out of n)

This is an explanation for the way in which new kinds of numbers were invented. It's a later part to the already published numbers-part-1

In this second part I attempt to explain how multiplication forced humans to come up with another kind of number: the rational number.

## Part II: Integers and rationals

I have been trying to write this part for a while, but I feel that without fully understanding "rings" (abstract algebraic rings) I cannot truly express what I intend. Lately I doubt my own capacity to learn anything, so here goes, without having understood: I talk out of my ass.


numbers are initially constructed from counting.

addition is a way to count by starting on different numbers.

summation is a further generalization of addition, it permits combining together as many numbers as we want in a "count-compatible way" (whatever I mean by "count-compatible"; this writing explores what this even means)


What I'm interested in understanding multiplication. But with multiplication there is no way to construct all numbers by 'adding' one. there is no one number to multiply by to get "the next number", the n+1 is an additive (summational, group-level definition)

n\*1 is a multiplication comparable to n+0, it is an action that changes nothing.

what would the "next-of" function (or operation) on `n` look like  using only multiplication?

if we know the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we can think about a way to get the next prime as a prerequisite to form all numbers from multiplications only.

but ingnorance of whether a number is prime is not easy to solve
