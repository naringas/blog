# Part I: the naturals

What are the real counting, natural, integer, rational, irrational, real, trascendental, complex, and algebraic numbers?

This is a storied explanation of the kinds of numbers inspired by a weakly historical -- vastly fictional -- account of their evolution.

## Counting numbers: ‚Ñï

In the beginning, once humans had become the owners of the land and started living close to other groups (or subgroups) of humans, trade among them began. Because of this, it was necessary to keep track of what -- and how much, they had stored and could trade.

The numbers don't care about what exactly gets traded; that's kind of the whole point about numbers.  
There could have been goats, cows, loaves of bread, vases of flour, anything. What is important is that there were trading by the unit.  
And so humans began using the simplest kind of numbers: the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number).

Some important attributes of the, aptly named, _counting_ numbers are the fact that each number is unique and fungible. This means that if a farmer has one pig, and one sheep, and 3 cows, the farm has a total of `1 + 1 + 3 = 5` animals.  
For the numbers it does not matter if they are cows, or horses, or bundles of hay.

Another key attribute is the fact that they are ordered, as the _counting_ numbers are made by _counting_, they have a natural implied order: _one_, then _two_, then _five_; but before _five_, there is _three_ and _four_, etc...  
The set of all these numbers, the __naturals__ (for short), is denoted with the special symbol "‚Ñï".

One of the simplest ways to define the _naturals_ is by sucession. There's some thing, any thing, and there's a succesor for each thing. There is 1 of something, and it has a succesor: 2 of something, and so on.

But the true power of numbers (all kinds of numbers), lies in the operations on numbers. By means of calculating -- performing operations directly on the numbers -- we can anticipate results before we actually execute the trade.


## Operations on numbers

The simplest kind of numbers in use by humans are associated with the simplest operation on numbers: addition; quite simply an extension of counting.

Recall that the natural counting numbers are built on succesion and succesion is equivalent to adding _one_. This is why addition is repeated sucession.  
If there are __7__ things, and we __add 2__ (i.e. addidtion of 7 and 2 or `7 + 2`) means start with 7 and add 1 ___twice___ (or `7 + 2 = succesor of succesor of 7 = 9`).

In a basic scenario such as addition, this is not very exciting. The real usefulness of operations begins when we ask for the opposite operation. Start with two numbers, but instead of adding them, we ask what other number would we need to add to one of them to get the other.

Start with _seven_ and _nine_ and ask _"what do I need to add to seven to get nine?"_, i.e. `7 + ùê± = 9`. This naturally will lead to the substraction operation: `9 ‚Äì 7 = 2`.

But what if we swap the seven and the nine in this example? _"what do I need to add to nine in order to get seven?"_. `7 ‚Äì 9 = ùê±`?  
This is a problem, granted -- it's only a problem if we are being rigorous. And mathematics are very rigorous.

The problem is that there isn't a natural counting number such that we can add it to 9 and get out 7. We constructed the naturals by sucession starting from zero (or one).  
Also, by the definition of addition here presented, it is impossible to count our way from nine to seven by succesion. We need to count our way _back down_.

The solution we need are negative numbers. The natural numbers together with the negative numbers are called the [integers numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) (the __integers__ for short) and they have the special symbol "‚Ñ§".
