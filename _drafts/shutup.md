I never quite wanted to be an artist, from an early age I was swayed away from the stage (by my mother's egotistical rejection of my own role as a secondary backstage participant in a kids music recital, my first so far as I can recall).

So I decided to focus on how art is made, rather than the art made. For me, since ever, the ARTFORM has been over sound i.e. music.

However I must admit that I do have an artistic impulse of self-expression. However, perhaps due to life-long tiny hands and an inherited interest to piano, I always found something not quite adequate about the possibilities afforded by that instrument.

Some decades later, after having studied technology, after having confronted my own inadequacies in this long winding path to understand how the heck music is made, and how it works, and how the instruments work; I came to understand that no external technology would give me the tools I felt I needed to express the music I wanted to make.

At one point, I considered the pincale of western music, the 12 tone scale (for me it's a system of scales) to be the problem. At this point, I consider that former attitude a reflection of my own ignorance about the minutiae and the incredible sophisticated system, after all, created over hundreds of years by already dead people. 

But what's spun me into a true crisis of life, is the fact that I've understood that all technology is ultimately a tool of imperialistic control from states to other states.

Which means that 12-tet, the tonal system was downladed from god by J.S. Bach, hidden by the Catholic church, and wielded as power over society ever since. Or something like that, my itch being the fact that they hide it away so to have authority.

Which means, that while I feel I'm on the verge of really undertanding how the heck chromaticism works, it's somehow clear that this has been such a difficult winding path because I cannot be truly permitted to skip over the strict hierarchies of technological control which exist not over me, but over my entire society and its institutions.

As I keep refusing to enroll into the closed way to do things -- a way in which I do something for you such that you cannot do it yourself, I cannot be permitted to approach the old dead stories behind how people came up with the incredibly nuanced systems of music.
The mysteries must be preserved, protected, occulted, and kept out of the hands of the unworthy, such as myself, who refuse to participate with the act of hiding things, lying about whence they came, and other various activities needed for the creation of mysteries and passions.

I suppose I must admit, that due to the ultimate nature of truth (god), they cannot truly stop me from having direct access to this entity from which it almost seems like Bach (and all others) have learned music. But they sure can get in my way. 

However, at a prior point in history, saying this words would have rendered me a heretic and imprissioned or worse. At least these days all the punishment I recieve is that nobody listens to me. A very effective way to punish SOUND artists. And a crucial necesity so that anything I can come up with that's not been already done can be hijacked and repurposed and traded around in an algorithmic driven market where the contents of the trade are irrelevant so long as the currency flows.

there's a tragedy in my character

that I want to be heard
that due to fear, smallness, trauma, rejection, I don't want to ask to be heard

that I can't ask you to hear me, yet I want you to

so then I play my sounds, and leave it at that. let the air take them, carry them to you.. or not

the air is not free anymore, it's been turned into sound; there has been too much noise (in part my fault as I had to learn to make nice sound; and before I did, the sounds were not nice)

so without air, with the new recorded signal, through electricity; I don't chose who listens; and I dare not ask for it
