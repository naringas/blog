# Spaces. Operators and variables. Parenthesis.

As I try to understand the decimal point I wonder about the role of spaces, variables, parenthesis and functions.

I think about different ways to encode the same numbers. I distinguish in my head a number from its repesentation.

# 0. Space

> The most important character has been taken for granted.

Suppose we already understand what is a number. I restate what is a number so we are on the same page.  
A number is anything such that it doesn't matter what exactly any of them is, only how many there are matters.
A number lets us answer "how many?" of anything as long as all the things can be precisely and consistently identifiable.

Choose that a number is a chain of succession operations starting from 0. This number zero corresponds to the void; it's most special number due to this relation with pure void; a tricky and special concept on its own.

Choose that we encode a number with a finite (but arbitrarily finite) number of _alphabetic digits_.
These digits correspond to an "alphabet" (meaning as a finite set of symbols). This alphabet must be stable, meaning it cannot change while we're counting (advancing on the succession of numbers to our target number).

Choose that the alphabet is an arbitray finite number of digit-symbols. 
This touches on our first complication: the use of the alphabet to define our number-encoding while using numbers to _index_ the alphabet (which defines the encoding...).

Observe that having chosen an alphabet (this notion pulled from formal-language theory), we have induced a special character: the blank `space`. 
This character permits a separation of multiple distinct numbers encoded by some arbitrary alphabet. In many use-cases, the role of the number separation is taken on by the comma "," e.g in lists or sets or sequences of numbers.
When numbers mix with words, the actual "space" character (ASCII 32 or 0x20) takes on this role. But in this particular sense they are the same character; they accomplish the same result.
Note how---regarless of the enormous qualtitative difference in use and interpretation---both: words written using alphabetic systems and specific numbers digitally encoded need a blank space symbol.
I'm amazed at the inevitability of the space symbol regardless of the alphabet chosen.


# 1. Operators and variables

> What is the difference between one and the succesor of zero?

An operator is really a function of limited arity. As an unary operation we have negation. Is this THE unique unary operation? (what does it take to make negation a unique unary operation?)
All binary can be re-encoded as operations.

The variable answers the question of the difference between one and zero's succesor.
By the variable they're the same.
wtf do I mean "by the variable"?

the arbitrary symbol. the alphabetic-symbolic re-interpretation.
The nonsense called the real numbers afforded, underpinned (but not qutie correctly blamed on) the "alphabetic" digital numeral system.
