What are the real conting, natural, integer, rational, irrational, real, trascendental, complex, and algebraic numbers?

This is a storied explanation of the kinds of numbers inspired by a weakly historical -- mostly fictional -- account of their evolution.

## In the begining 

Once humans begun owning things and started trading them with other humans, it became necessary to keep track of what they were trading.

Whether you were trading vases of grain, farm animals, or anything else, is not important. What is important is that you were trading units of something.

The word-root ["merx"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/merchandise)
: The romans used a single word to refer to whatever was being traded. This word inspired the words "market", "mercantile", "merchandise". Ultimately the word was inspired by the supposed [god of tradesmen and thieves](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Mercury).

And so humans began using the simplest kind of numbers: the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) (also known as the _counting_ numbers).

The set of all these numbers, the __naturals__ (for short) is denoted with the special symbol "ℕ".

So far, the key attributes of this _counting_ numbers are the fact that each number is unique.  
This means that if a farmer has one pig and one sheep, the farm has one of each. For the number (1 in this case) it does not matter if they are pigs, or cows, or horses.

And another key attribute is the fact that they are ordered, as the _counting_ numbers are made by _counting_, they have a natural order. _One_, then _two_, then _five_ but before 5, _three_ and _four_, and so on.

The simplest way to define the _naturals_ is by sucession. There's some thing, any thing, and there's a succesor for each thing. There is 1 of something, and it has a succesor: 2 of something, etc...

### Operations on numbers

In order ro really take advantage of the power of numbers we need to have operations on numbers. The simplest operation on numbers is addition. Which a simply extension of counting. In a sense, counting is just the addition of 1. Addition is repeated sucession.

The interesting thing about operations on numbers is that we can always ask for the opposite operation. We can pick two numbers and then wonder what other number would we need to add to one of them to get the other. 

If we pick the same number twice and ask what do we need to add to get the same number the answer is zero. Which, depneding on who you ask might be -- or not -- a natural number. As introduced, the natural numbers are the counting numbers, therefore zero is not really a natural number (how do you count zero things of anything?).

And so already the addition operation introduces some "problems". Granted, this is only a problem if we are being rigorous; and we are.

But it gets worse, what happens if we ask what natural number we need to add to get a smaller number?  
If adding means repeatedly take the next number, then there is no way to take 8 and add our way up to 5.

The answer is -- of course substraction, but really it is negative numbers.

And so addition introduces a new kind of number beyond the natural numbers. Now there are _negative_ numbers.

The set of all numbers both postive (i.e. natural numbers) and negative is called the [integers numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer). The __integers__ have the special symbol "ℤ".


## Baking lots of bread

One day a very wealthy and clever baker, having bought 5 vases of flour wanted to know how many loaves of bread he would be able to make with those 5 vases.

It was common knowneldge among bakers that one vase should be enough to bake 12 bagels. But what about 5 of them?

Being a clever person, the baker realized that it was necessary to add the 12 bagels from the first vase to the 12 from the second, and the 12 from the third, the fourth, and the fifth.

Having done that the baker realzied that his oven could only bake 6 loaves at a time. And there were 60 loaves made and waiting to be baked.
