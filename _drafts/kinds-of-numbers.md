What are the real conting, natural, integer, rational, irrational, real, trascendental, complex, and algebraic numbers?

This is a storied explanation of the kinds of numbers inspired by a weakly historical -- mostly fictional -- account of their evolution.

# In the begining

Once humans begun owning things and started trading them with other humans, it became necessary to keep track of what you were trading.

Whether you were trading vases of grain (as a farmer), or farm animals (as a shepperd) is not important. What is important is that you were trading units of something. 

The word-root ["merx"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/merchandise)
: The romans used a single word to refer to whatever was being traded. This word inspired the words "market", "mercantile", "merchandise". Ultimately the word was inspired by the supposed [god of tradesmen and thieves](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Mercury).

And so humans began using the simplest kind of numbers: the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) (also known as the _counting_ numbers).

The set of all these numbers, the _naturals_ (for short) is denoted with the special symbol "â„•".
