These are my notes from reading this text by Philip K. Dick.

[The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exegesis_of_Philip_K._Dick) is a compilation of Philip's personal letters from the mid 70s until his death.

I discovered this book by looking at [tekgnostics'](https://www.tekgnostics.com/) [favorite parts](https://www.tekgnostics.com/PDK.HTM).
But in fact, the entire book is a rather long compendium of personal letters. It's over 1000 pages long. After some heavy goolging I managed to locate a PDF somewhere in the internet and have been slowly reading it through. I will write my own commentary about it in this blog.
