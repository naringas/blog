So I've given up trying to get a master's degree in comptuers. I went, I took all my classes got all the credits. I wrote a thesis over 4 long semesters. I handed it in one semster later, on the 5th... and that's it. I fizzled away. I gave up. I decided I'd gotten what I needed and I did not know what to next. AND I refused to let inertia choose for me.

for once in my life, on the year I was as old as my dad was when I was born, I said "enough is enough". I may have the same name, the same birthday. I may have gone to the same schools. But damned if I'm the same person as my old man. I must walk my own way... I hope... or maybe I'm too lazy to finish a masters? or maybe I'm too alienated to be able to get one??

regardless, I spent an extra year "doing my thesis" at the behest of my advisor who seems to have done more than me to get me to finish this thing.

and still did not go through the whole ritual dance of being lectured about the same stubborn things until I just let them tell me what to say on my thesis while pretending I'm saying it just so we can be done with this _"beautiful tradition in higher education"_. So I let it drop like the millennial that I am. fuck it. Keep your degree title; this faculty doesn't even offer the degree I really want anyways... but I only know that now, having tried to get it; see! I did learn something just not what I was supposed to.

Near the end, I walked away. But then I looked back. I tried to attend a couple of seminars for another semester. and still I gave up and walked away again.

but I had finally realized that, if any, I should pursue a degree in arts, not in any science. 

But who grants degrees in arts? and to whom? and which of them are worth a while to me? and for which of them (if any) am I worth any while???

I guess I must go and find that out now.
