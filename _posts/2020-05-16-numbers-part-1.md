What are the real counting, natural, integer, rational, irrational, real, trascendental, complex, and algebraic numbers?

This is a made up explanation of the kinds of numbers.

## Part I: naturals and integers

### Counting numbers: ‚Ñï

A long time ago humans begun trading. Because of the trading, it became necessary to keep track of what -- and more importantly how much, they had traded already and how much they could still trade.

The numbers don't care about what the specifics of the merchandize being traded. If it was goats, cows, loaves of bread, vases of flour, enslaved people, it dosen't matter. Only the fact that there were trading by the unit.  
And so humans began using the simplest kind of numbers: the [natural (or counting) numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number).

Some important attributes of the, aptly named, _counting_ numbers are the fact that each number is unique and fungible. This means that if a farmer has one pig, and one sheep, and 3 cows, the farm has a total of `5 = 1 + 1 + 3` animals.  
For the numbers it does not matter if they are goats, or horses, or bundles of hay.

Another key attribute is the fact that they are ordered, as the _counting_ numbers are made by _counting_, they have a natural implied order: _one_, then _two_, then _five_; but before _five_, there is _three_ and _four_, you get the idea...  
The set (i.e. the mathematical collection) of all these numbers, the __naturals__ (for short), is denoted with the special symbol "‚Ñï".

One of the simplest ways to construct the _naturals_ is by sucession. There's some thing, any thing, and there's a succesor for each thing. There is 1 of something, and it has a succesor: 2 of something, then 3, 4, and so on.

But the true power of numbers (all kinds of numbers), lies in the operations on numbers. By means of calculating -- performing operations directly on the numbers -- we can anticipate results before we actually execute (in this case) the trade.


### Operations on numbers

The simplest kind of numbers in use by humans are associated with the simplest operation on numbers: addition; quite simply an extension of counting.  
Recall that the natural counting numbers are built on succesion; and succesion is equivalent to _add one_. In this sense addition is simply repeated sucession.

If there are __7__ things and we __add 2__ (i.e `7 + 2`), this transaltes into: start with __7__ and _add one_ __twice__. Take the succesor of the succesor of 7; which equals 9.
This basic scenario is equivalent to asking _"what do we get if we start with 7 units and add 2 more?"_.

This is a rather simple example, but we can also ask more complex questions. For example the opposite to the previous one: _"what do we need to add to 7 in order to get 9?"_ i.e. `7 + ùê± = 9`. So far so good, the answer is 2.  
But what if we swap the seven and the nine? _"what do we need to add to 9 in order to get 7?"_ i.e. `9 + ùê± = 7`.

If we were being rigorous this would be a problem; and since this is mathematics -- we are being rigiorous. This is a problem; luckily it is a solved problem.

The issue is that there isn't a natural counting number such that we can add it to 9 and get out 7. We constructed the naturals by sucession. It is not possible to advance your way from 9 back to 7.

The solution we need are negative numbers. The natural numbers together with the negative numbers are called the [integers numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) (the __integers__ for short) and they have the special symbol "‚Ñ§".
